# Estimating-Pi-Using-Monte-Carlo-Methods

This project estimates the value of Pi using Monte Carlo methods. It includes three parts:
1. Estimate Pi using a fixed number of random points (for loop).
2. Estimate Pi using a precision-based approach (while loop).
3. A function that estimates Pi with user-defined precision and plots the points.

## Usage Instructions
- Clone the repository or download the files.
How to use the code:
1) For loop method(fixed points): This part of the code use for loops with a specified number of points. The code is written to use 500 points but this value can be modified.
2) While loop (precision based): This section estimates pi to a fixed level of precision; you can choose the precision level ( either 2 or 3 decimal points). 
- Run the MATLAB files in your local MATLAB environment.
- To run the Pi estimation with user-defined precision, use the function `estimatePiSimple(precision)`, where `precision` is either 2 or 3 for two or three decimal places.
